 Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line is a tool you can use on your computer to interact with other programs and files. This is done by typing commands into the command line telling your computer what you want to do. For instance, if you wanted to open a file you would type open and then the name of the file rather than double clicking on it with your mouse. You can do lots of different things with the command line all using just a few commands.

ls - shows a list of all the files in the directory you are currently in
cd {directory name} - navigate to another diectory(Or folder) within the directory you are currently in(i.e. a directory shown when you enter ls).
cd .. - Takes you up one level into the directory which the directory you're currently in is inside.
cd ~ - Go to your home directory, this, by default, is where Directories like Documents, Downloads, Music etc. are stored.
cd / - Takes you to your root directory, this is the uppermost directory of the computer which all other files and directories on your computer are stored.
mkdir {filename} - makes a new directory in the directory you are currently in with a specified name.
touch {filename} -makes a new file in the directory you are currently in with a specified name.
rm {filename} - deletes a file with the specified name.
rm -r {filename} - deletes a directory with the specified name.
mv {filename} {new filename} - changes the name of the specified file or directory to the newly specified name.
